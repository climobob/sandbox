     The first NWP was done by L. F. Richardson, between ambulance runs

   model attempted was a primitive equation model with 6 layers in the
   vertical.  Only a single active grid point was used in the horizontal.
   (There were several lateral boundary points supplying information.)
   The computation was done on an adding machine.

     The first _successful_ NWP was done shortly after world war II, by
   a team led (taking authorship of the paper) by J. Charney, Fjortoft,
   and J. von Neumann, 1948.  This model greatly simplified the governing
   equations (treated the atmosphere as a single layer), but was applied
   at continental scale (much of North America).  The computations were
   done on the ENIAC.

     Is anyone other than me interested in programs which would implement
   those two models?

     As a general note, if you have copies of classic old models, please
   write me.

Bob,

	Richardson's work has been replicated most recently by Peter
Lynch.  He gave an excellent talk on it at last year's Symposium on
Extratropical Cyclones.  See:

Lynch, P., 1994:  Richardson's marvellous forecast. Conference

pp. 38-48.

Thank you for your help, do you mean you are interested by this book
"La prevision du temps et du climat"?

OK, I'm too young to have known this "octagonal" period,
and I searched by mistake the 65 to 75 period in our library.
I'll try to search earlier, but journals and books become quite
rare from this period.... let's hope.

I'm co-writing at present time a paper on the problem of the map
factor in our METEO-FRANCE operational model when used with
variable resolution and semi-lagrangian options.
It seems that NMC octagon model was the first model in
which the total variations of map factor in the domain were
significant (probably a factor 2, but I wanted to
check with the descriptions in papers). 
Of course they did not have the same kind of problem as us since
I guess they had not semi-lagrangian, semi-implicit, two-time level
scheme, high resolution and so on... I would just like to quote
a reference about this model.

Please note my e-mail adress if you have more precisions:
