Notes:

regionalize reads in allice.summary (from 'bulk'), and all the ice 
    observations then compute and write out the correlation vectors for 
    (all, now) points, plus figure of merit ('scores')

Given correlation vectors and scores, 'partition' picks up points with 
    maximum scores and then partitions field according to rcrit (its 1 
    argument).

iterate.gs will make maps of first N regions.
