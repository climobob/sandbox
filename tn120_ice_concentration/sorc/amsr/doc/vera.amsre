Hi Bob,
Form Walter's information and after a discussion with Jeff Ator, I have decoded AMSR-e
"2" channel "4" spot sounding sequence(89 GHz/HORN-B) data. The code, script, makefile
and readme are located on cirrus at: /marine/save/wx21vg/amsre/btmps .
sorc  - decodsat.f
make - make.decodsat
script - decodsat.sh
exec  - decodsat.x
readme - readme
Let me know if you see an error.
Cheers,
Vera
