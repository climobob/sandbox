Recomputing the sea ice history

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The original sea ice history available from here
was constructed by saving each day's ice cover analysis as it was produced.&nbsp;
The production methods changed through time, resulting in better analyses
for the day, but introducing artefacts when the resulting fields were considered
for climatological purposes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, we are rebuilding the climate-oriented
series with a fixed method and reference fields.
<BR>The current recomputed time series, beginning with October 1, 1995
and running to the present, is available in <A HREF="ftp://polar.wwb.noaa.gov/pub/ice/global/">ftp://polar.wwb.noaa.gov/pub/ice/global/</A>.&nbsp;
There is also a readme file present which describes the current level of
processing and the support files used (in particular, the land mask, which
is now notably different than the one previously used).&nbsp; In time,
this series will run self-consistently from late 1978 to the present.&nbsp;
It will be recomputed in its entirity whenever we learn of either an error
in the processing (rare, we hope)&nbsp;or of better methods for analysis.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the revised daily series, we are now
computing integral quantities, such as monthly summaries and areas.&nbsp;
The daily areas may be viewed on the experimental analysis page, at <A HREF="http://polar.wwb.noaa.gov/seaice/expt.analy/Welcome.html">http://polar.wwb.noaa.gov/seaice/expt.analy/Welcome.html</A>.
