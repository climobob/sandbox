Subject: Sea Ice data

Dear Dr. Bob Grumbine,

I compared your data with those made by Nationa Snow and Ice data center during
December 1991.  It is very nice that the difference of sea ice limit(determined
by 55% sea ice concentration) between them was very small.  I have already
converted them until July 1993.  It is very interesting that the feature of the
polynya over the Ross Sea in 1992 spring season was different from that of the
other normal years.

I read your document.
(2.1) My name and organization are

  Atsushi Nomura
  ECMWF.

address of ECMWF is
  Shinfield Park, Reading,
  Berkshire, RG2 9AX, U.K.

(2.2) Our project is formally called ECMWF Re-Analysis Project, but you may not
care for the title, I think.

(2.4) I must consult with the manager about this item.  I cannot answer now.

I am now writing a description about the sea ice data set that I created.  I
have a plan to submit it to the ECMWF technical Memorandum.  A copy of the
manuscript will be brought to Dr. Kanamitsu on next Monday.  Because Per
Kallberg, one of reanalysis staffs, will visit Washington to discuss the
situation of reanalysis projects and I asked him to bring my manuscript to him.

With best regards.

Atsushi Nomura.

Dear Mr. Nomura,

  I'm sorry for the problems on the SSMI F-11 files.  I got caught
by the problems of reading in HDF files and had a couple mistakes.

  Proper mask files are now available in the 
pub/nws/nmc/development/ecmwf/f11ice directory on nic.fb4.noaa.gov.
They are named nmask.2 and smask.2.  These and the ice concentration
files are unformatted binary files, 1 byte (8 bits, 1 character)
per pixel.  The land masks are 0 and 1.  The concentrations are
the usual percentage encoding with the following exceptions:
157 still denotes land.
200 and 224 denote bad or missing data points.
concentrations are not capped at 100% (values up to 128 occur
 routinely).

  Further note, in my attempt to read the hdf files from the disk,
I erred on the number of header bytes.  There are 17 fewer than I
thought.  This accounts for the overlapped image appearance (the
Aleutians appearing next to England).  The quick solution is
to read in the map file as a vector of bytes, set the first 17 bytes
of the concentration map to zero (never have ice there anyhow), 
then sequentially (in first index then second) copy from the vector
into the concentration map.  I will do this for our copy of the
files.  If you don't mind waiting for this to be run (and transferred),
I can upload to nic the revised files.

  In the mean time, the rest of the files (to 9308) are on nic.  
They must (as always) be transferred via binary ftp.


On another matter:

  I've been approached by the ISLSCP (International Satellite Land
Surface Climatology Project) about providing sea ice concentration
maps on monthly-averaged 1 degree lat-long grids for 1987 and 1988.
For test purposes, I've already reformatted the monthly averages
you've developed and created a sample description.  I would 
definitely not like to send the documentation out with only my
name, but also would not want to list you against your wishes.
(For that matter, there's no need for my name to appear at all.)
I have uploaded the documentation start and the monthly averaged
maps to nic at pub/nws/nmc/development/ecmwf/islscp.  The averages
are compressed tar files, so need to be transferred binary.  The
documentation file is plain text.

Sincerely,
Bob Grumbine

Dear Dr. Grumbine,

Sorry I forgot 17bytes shift of the data.  Considering the shift, I could get
reasonable results.  Thank you very much.

Dear Dr. Grumbine,

I decoded some of the sea ice data and converted into 1x1 latitude/longitude
mesh data.  However the converted data have a problem.  It seems that
coordinates of the whole data are shifted to one direction.  For my feeling,
    Northern hemisphere  : direction 160W
                           amount    7-8 degrees
    Southern hemisphere  : direction  90W
                           amount    4-5 degrees
I have confirmed that the land/sea mask you offered me was consistent with that
we have. I doubt that you have some problems in convertion calculation from
satellite orbital coordinate to polar-streographinc coordinate for sea ice data.

I sent a postscript file (icemap.ps) of a sea ice coverage map that I created
under the directory
   /pub/nws/nmc/development/ecmwf


Siccerely,
Atsushi Nomura

  Just to make sure that thI read the messages in the right order:
The first note was about the problem with lining up the map and land mask,
and the second was to say that you caught the prproblem that althought
the sea ice concentrations had been shifted 17 bytes, the land mask hadn't?

  The maps do look like that is the problem.  I am sorry about this
error.  It sounds like you've gotten the byte shifting program written,
but if not, I'm going to put the C code I used for that into the
f11ice directory.  The arguments are oldname newname where oldname is
the conc.930101 file c(for example) that is on the nic, and newname is
whatever you want.  I'll also put up the script I used (yesterday) to
cycle through all the files.  If you're moderately familiar with Unix,
it should be easy to modify as needed.

Sorry for the problems.
