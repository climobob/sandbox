README:

  Source codes and scripts used in generating the new CDAS sea ice
from the NSIDC F-11 TB CD's.  You must have the HDF libraries installed
for the nsidc.c and nsidc.south.c programs to link and execute.

0) Files need to be renamed and changed permission prior to executing the codes:
mv nsidc.sou nsidc.south.c
mv nsidcgri.h nsidcgrid.h
chmod u+x filt reanl.*
mv filtnsid.c filtnsidc.c

1) Construct ice concentration grids from the NSIDC TB's:
  Scripts reanl.X will carry this out.  They require that you
have the programs nsidc and nsidc.south compiled already.  

2) Remap the ice concentrations from the native polar stereographic
to a 1 degree latitude-longitude grid.
  The script filt will carry this out.  It requires programs
ones, tfill, and filtnsidc, and wgrib (or some other grib reader) and
1 degree sst fields.
  The new remapping is to average concentrations from the polar stereographic
grid on to the latitude-longitude grid.  If no polar stereographic 
grid point falls on to a latitude-longitude grid point (which occurs 
at high latitudes due to the convergence of the meridions), the nearest
polar stereographic grid point is used.  The old remapping used the
nearest neighbor concentration everywhere.
