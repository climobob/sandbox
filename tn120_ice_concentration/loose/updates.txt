Updates to the old 25.4 km and 1/2 degree (30 minute) MMAB sea ice products

   10 August 2004

     * The digital files now carry a flag value of 157, specifying the point
       as being land .
     * More points are now water than formerly.  Any point at these
       resolutions which corresponds to at least one grid point resolvable at
       higher resolution is treated as water, and the value for the non-land
       higher resolution grid is averaged onto the low resolution grid.
     * The masking around the Aral Sea was changed, to be more in accord with
       the shrinkage it has undergone in the past 40 years.  There are now
       many more land points there.
     * The weather filtering seems to be more effective at removing points
       which are severe weather, rather than ice cover.  If you formerly
       relied on the ice flag being 'bad conditions', let us recommend the
       Hazard Summary at [1]http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/products.html as
       a more direct way to get a look at bad conditions.
