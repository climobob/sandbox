SSMI Bufr:

Cray span:
IBM span:

-- can cray bufr still be read on IBM or desktop?
-- read bufr on desktop, stommel, IBM
-- Time to process scan points into lakes?
-- Subset into 'near Crystal lake'

ssmi.bufr.f
 later, added hiresobs, satno
 thence binary.c for unblocked/unformatted file output

------------------------ Reading -------------------------------------------
To Read On Desk (Linux):
  Run cwordsh on IBM with unblk option, then transfer file to desk
(directly running cwordsh on desk fails)
  -- still failing.  There are byte count sensitivities in the main(?).

To Read on Stommel (SGI Origin):
  Run with saved IBM version, or with IBM version that has gone through
cwordsh block.  cwordsh unblk fails.
  Takes approx 3 minutes to decode and write out 1 day's files   
 
To Read on CCS (IBM Power4 system):
  Run with saved IBM version, or with IBM version that has gone through
cwordsh block.  cwordsh unblk fails.
  Takes approx 1:30 minutes to decode and write out 1 day's files
