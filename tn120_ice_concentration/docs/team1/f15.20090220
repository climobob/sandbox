 Glenn (20:27:48) :

There has been and are significant problems with the F15 satellite.

“Since 2006-Aug-14 UTC, SSM/I F15 22GHz(V) channel has been degraded by a RADCAL beacon. The interference has been characterized and removed; ocean products are now available.”

“SSM/I F15 from August 14, 2006 to the present should not be used for climate work.”

“Beacon Alert!!!
The F15 beacon problem has gotten much worse, beginning January 15, 2009.
Until further notice, do not use recent SSM/I F15 for research.”

“Also carried on board DMSP F15 is an experimental payload, called the Radar Calibration (RADCAL) beacon, that is used to transmit C-band data for the purpose of testing C-band tracking radar performance at Vandenberg Air Force Base. RADCAL also transmits Doppler data for the Naval Research Laboratory’s Coherent Electromagnetic Tomography (CERTO) experiment.

The RADCAL beacon operates at 150 MHz and 400 MHz. On-orbit testing conducted in August 2005 confirmed that transmissions from the RADCAL 150 Mhz beacon produced interference in the SSM/I 22 GHz vertical polarization (22V) channel and that the 400 Mhz beacon interfered with SSMT-2 channel 4 performance. The SSMT-2 on F15 has since been declared non-operational due to an unrelated component failure. Thus, users of F15 SSM/I data should be advised that the 22V channel will be dramatically degraded during RADCAL beacon transmission, particularly with regards to snow classification and depth.”
