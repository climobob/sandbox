Dear Dr. Cavalieri,

I have completed the re-analysis of the f8 and f11 Greenland
data. I started from the beginning and worked in parallel with
Nick. We came up with the same brightness temperatures for
comparison, and after applying the regression routine (actually
2 different routines for verification), the final values are:


channel     slope     intercept | Correlation Coef. (R)
-------     -----     --------- | --------------------
  19h       1.013      -1.89    |       0.993
  19v       1.013      -2.51    |       0.994
  22v       1.014      -2.73    |       0.993
  37h       1.024      -4.22    |       0.993
  37v       1.000       0.052   |       0.993


and they should be used as follows:
   F11(corrected) = [slope x F11(uncorrected)] + intercept

These numbers are correct, and they will not change.

To be thorough, I am going to revisit the Antarctica values. They
they are not of much use for instrument comparison, since the brightness
temperature differences are so much more strongly influenced by diurnal
variations than the instrument differences, but given what has happened
with the Greenland values, I think another check is in order.

I appreciate how understanding and patient you have been, and I am
sorry for all of the problems.

Sincerely,
Waleed Abdalati
