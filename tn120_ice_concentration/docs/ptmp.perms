Do ls -ld of that sorc directory on snow.  You will probably
find it does not have setgid set.  Check your other permissions
(for example 755) and do chmod 2755 sorc.  This will
set the group id.  Replace 755 with the permissions you
actually have on sorc if they are different.
ls -ld sorc
drwxr-xr-x   5 wx22dk   staff         16384 May 01 12:09 sorc
s1n1 >ls -ld ../wx22dk
drwxr-sr-x   7 wx22dk   staff         16384 May 01 12:03 ../wx22dk


 The wx22dk directory has s in place of x in the group permissions.
THis indicates setgid is on.  Most directories on /ptmp have this on now
and once on it propagates to new directories.

The sorc directory indeed does not have it on so I'll fix it.

I've logged in as root and changed it.
