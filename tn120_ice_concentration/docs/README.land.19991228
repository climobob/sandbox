  Constructing the land masks involves three compilations and a check 
program.  There is one compilation for each of the global, 
northern hemisphere, and southern hemisphere grids.  The check program 
fills all of both hemispheres, exclusive of the land or coast points, 
with ice, and then checks to see whether every point that is not land 
in the global grid receives an ice cover.  The logic of the grid program
is the same, regardless of the grid used, so the grid selection is 
managed by a define during compilation ex:  -DGRIDTYPE=southgrid.  
Any 'ncepgrid' may be used here.

  The primary variable which might be changed due to differences in 
policy is in filter.C: required_fraction.  It is currently 0.8.  This
means that a grid box will only be called land (or sea) if more than
80% of the points from the 1/16th degree land mask are land (or sea).
In between, the point will be called coast.

  Note that this definition makes no allowance for sensor footprint sizes.
A point may well have so much nearby land that a given sensor may never
get a reliable observation of the water which is declared to be present.
This must be decided separately.  To that end, the percentage of each grid
cell which is land is also printed out.

  Execution time is approximately 5 minutes on a Pentium-II 266.
  
Directory contents:
pss4.C         : program that reads in land/sea tags and generates masks
filter.C       : function (called by pss4) that applies the land/sea filtering
region.C       : function (not currently used) that prints out tag values inside
                   a region.
landin.C       : functions to manage the NESDIS tag file.
nesdis.h       : include file defining nesdis-file related quantities
surface_tags.h : include file defining sea ice product surface tags
masktest.C : Diagnostic consideration of the land masks from all three
               grids.
temp.orig : the original NESDIS tag file.  It is the wrong 'endian' for
            Linux boxes.  If needed on your machine, you need to copy 
            this to temphigh and include -DFLIP in your CPPFLAGS in the 
            makefile 
temphigh.linux  : temp.orig after dd if=temp.orig of=temphigh conv=swab
              Correct endian-ness for Linux.
temphigh  : the Nesdis input file actually read by the programs.
Makefile  : as name

Usage:
make, to make the files and test the result

The files names nland.new, sland.new, and newland contain the new
editions of the northern hemisphere, southern hemisphere, and global
land masks.


Developmental:
bordfilt.C   : as filter.C, but with tools for putting in borders
psbord.C     : as makeland.C, but calling bordfilt.C


Unused files present for historic reasons:
zmask zmask.reform  (old MRF 1 degree land mask files)
