seaice_filtanal.Cd : replaces seaice_filtanal.fd
  change to 12.7 km and 5' grids from 25.4 km and 30' grids.
  change a logical test to be less verbose

seaice_icegrid.Cd : replaces seaice_icegrid.fd
  change to 5' global grid
  handle case of there being no prior global analysis field

seaice_ssmibufr.fd : 
  binary.c     -- includes high resolution output now
  ssmi.bufr.f  -- includes F15 and high resolution output now

seaice_xpm.Cd : replaces seaice_xpm.cd
  No code changes
  Makefile now builds codes for 5 minute global 12.7 km hemispheric grids.

seaice_reduce.Cd : NEW
  Codes to construct reduced resolution grids from higher resolutions.
  3 executables are built, one each for northern hemisphere, southern 
    hemisphere, and global.

seaice_seaissmi.cd :
  Source split in to logical groups
  Code modified for new, higher resolution, 12.7 km versus 25.4 km, 
    processing of SSMI to sea ice concentrations.

seaice_psgsouth.fd : 
seaice_psgnorth.fd : 
seaice_ice2grib.fd : 
  Same source code used for both old and new resolutions.  
  Difference lies in the included file icegrid.inc (see makefile)
