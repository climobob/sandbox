Subject: 10% paging threshold
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

all,

ibm has the proposed the following to get around the current 300 MB heap and stack limit
for dev jobs on prod machine.  i think this will work well but the 10% paging kill applies
to all jobs not just preempted ones.   If you have an issue with this send me an email
or stop by to discuss.

thanks,
mike

4) Extra Item (not discussed) - IBM has suggested that we implement two levels of monitoring for
paging jobs.  The first level will cancel  dev jobs almost as soon as they start paging (when 10% of
paging is used or 400 MB). The second level (which is already implemented) will cancel ALL jobs on a
node if paging hits 85%. This could be quite helpful, but needs to be implemented on both machines.  The
positive side is that it could help us safely raise the data and stack limit on the prod machine (or not use
it as all), because we would cancel dev jobs after it pages for a short time.  The negative side is that
even on the dev machine, all of the jobs running will have to fit in memory and still a little bit of paging
would occur on the prod (and dev) side before being cancelled (but not over 3 GB's worth!).  Checking
the usage of the system,  the dev nodes don't seem to be using more than a few percent of paging space.
