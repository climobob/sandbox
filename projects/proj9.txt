Project: SST, Ice – analysis variance w.r.t. Hires analysis of down-averaged grids (e.g. 2 degree box vs. 5' analysis)

End Point: Analysis with conclusions about how the un-analyzed variance is a function of degree of averaging.  Should lead to decisions about how to consistently reduce resolution from the full system.

Requires: 
programming
sst data and/or sea ice data
