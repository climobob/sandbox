trends.f is the program and ncdc.reformed is the data file used in my
blog post http://moregrumbinescience.blogspot.com/2009/01/results-on-deciding-trends.html

The trends program outputs two sections of results.  First is a 3 column look at the
forward, centered, or backwards trends, as functions of the averaging length.

Second is specifically the centered trend for 25 year trend computations.

It isn't pretty output, but it works.  Output is nearly suitable for spreadsheets,
being comma-delimited.  The exception being that you'll want to split the output 
into two separate files.
