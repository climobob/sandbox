Dear Robert,
I haven't received anything from you and I do not know
if the problem was my Vax account.  We have had power
problems during the weekend.  I wanted to give you my Unix 
account addresses so you can have them just in case.

I look forward to hearing from your model runs,
Ricardo

Dear Robert,
I have been trying to get in touch with you for the last
three weeks without luck.  I am trying from this account
now to see if this message reaches you.  
Are you going to the AGU Fall Meeting?  I will probably 
be there.
Good luck,
Ricardo
