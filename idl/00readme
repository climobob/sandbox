This directory contains two sample Interactive Display Language (IDL) programs 
that can read and display the DMSP F-11 SSM/I Brightness Temperature files on 
this CDROM. The IDL code includes the ability to apply one of three overlays 
to the image on the screen: a land mask, a coastline mask or a 
latitude/longitude mask. To execute this program, one must have a version of 
IDL that supports Hierarchical Data Format (HDF). IDL version 3.0 or later
contains utilities for manipulating data stored in HDF. This code was written 
and tested on a DECstation/ULTRIX running IDL version 3.5.1.

When using a CDROM drive that mounts a CDROM using the ISO9660 standard, the
user will observe that all filenames will appear in UPPER-CASE. For some 
systems such as SUN and SGI the filenames will appear in lower-case. In the 
latter case, all paths and filenames in the IDL code must be changed to 
lower-case before executing this IDL code.

To compile this program type at the IDL command line:

IDL> .run display_f11_xa.pro	(You may need to add the path to this program)
		or		(eg. .run /cdrom/TOOLS/IDL/DISPLAY_F11_XA.PRO )
IDL> .run display_f11.pro     	(use UPPERCASE or lowercase as needed.)


To run this program type: 

	IDL> display_f11_xa,tb	or	IDL> display_f11,tb

Note: 'tb' is a returned variable that contains data to be displayed.

Here is an sample session. (User responses are indicated after the :'s)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

IDL> display_f11_xa,tb

Enter the start date (eg. 911203)
:911221

Enter the stop date  (eg. 911231)
:911221

Enter the hemisphere (1 = northern)
	             (2 = southern)
:1

Enter the channel to display (1-7)
 1   2   3   4   5   6   7
--- --- --- --- --- --- ---
19H 19V 22V 37H 37V 85H 85V
:2

Enter the path to the data.
eg. /cdrom or /mnt  -  (a CDROM mount point or files on hard disk)
:/cdrom

Enter an IDL window number where the dates will be displayed
: 1

Do you wish to overlay a mask file?
coastline, lat/lon or land mask
y/n
:y

The northern hemisphere 12.5 km resolution has 3 overlays to choose from:
1 - N3BCOAST.HDF - (a coastline)
2 - N3BLTLN.HDF  - (lat/lon grids)
3 - N3BMASK.HDF  - (a land mask)

Enter a number (1-3) for the overlay.
:2



!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

An image will appear in the window that you have selected.





A very short list of some IDL commands (for use with display_f11.pro):

tvscl - procedure that scales the intesnsity values of the image into the
	range of the display and outputs the data to the image display.

	ex.	IDL> tvscl,tb
		IDL> tvscl,tb(*,*,5) - displays the 5th image of a 3-D array.

tv    -	procedure that displays images on the image display without scaling
	the intensity.

	ex.	IDL> tv,tb
		IDL> tv,tb(*,*,5)

loadct-	procedure that loads a color palette.

	ex.	IDL> loadct   - a list of possible selection will appear.
		IDL> loadct,23 - load the 23rd color palette.
