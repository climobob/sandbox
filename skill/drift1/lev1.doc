#Control files
Makefile  : Make all the executables.  
            Also make the travelling package (make travel)
            Note that some routines are non-standard and internal to the 
              crays (date, minv, fftfax, rfftmlt), so that skile2.model 
              will not run on other machines.  sphert94a is the user of 
              the fftfax, rfftmlt, and minv routines.  Date is a date 
              function.

skile.inc : Include file which describes the drift model and the 
            meteorological forecast model.

geo.jcl   : File which controls the execution of the model and its
              support programs.  The 'fetch'es will run only on the
              C-90 and Y-MP (as of 22 March 1995), and require different
              id's on both machines  (-mVX on Y-MP, -mVS on the C-90). 

#Programs: iceqc, akprep, skpoints, skile2.model
iceqc.f    : Program (no calls) which prints out the land mask derived 
               by the old second generation wave model from the NIC ice 
               line.  For quality control of the ice line product by the 
               NIC.

akprep.f   : Program (no calls) which combines the skiles model output 
               and the Thorndike and Colony model output (skile2.model) 
               for day 6 and produces a file for guidance of the Anchorage 
               WSFO.

skpoints.f : Program (no calls) which computes the latitude and 
               longitude of the 207 original Skiles points, and an 
               augmented list for the southern hemisphere.

skile2.f   : Program (calls the rest of the routines listed) to compute 
               the geostrophic wind, compute the free drift ice velocity 
               (Thorndike and Colony 1982 for the Arctic, Martinson and 
               Wamser, 1990 for the Antarctic), and move a fictitious 
               freely drifting floe for each forecast period.  Output 
               consists of drift distance and direction for all virtual 
               floes.  This includes the fixed set (computed by skpoints) 
               and a reduced set of points from the NIC iceline file for 
               the day.

#Routines:
sk2setup.f : Set up the locations of the drift points -- read in the 
               skiles points file and the iceline files, remove iceline 
               points which are closer than minsep (set in skile2, 
               presently 50 km) km from a currently used iceline point.  
               In the event of no skiles point file, use a few hard coded 
               points from the Bering Sea.  Do nothing extra if there are 
               no points in the iceline files.

getsig.f   : Read in the topography, sea level pressure, and lowest 
               layer temperature from the spectral sigma file.  Assume 
               that the sigma file is attached appropriately in the 
               control script (-Fcos -Nibm).  Only routine which needs
               to know the spectral resolution of the data before starting.

atmos.f    : Manage the computation of fields required from the atmosphere.  
               Early in history this was a moderately elaborate routine.  
               Presently, it only calls geowin, the routine which computes 
               the geostrophic wind.
geowin.f   : Compute the geostrophic 'surface' wind.  The surface is 
               actually at the level that the MRF considers the surface 
               to be (ztopo), which is not necessarily zero elevation 
               over the oceans.

movice.f   : Compute the motion of the free-drift ice floes given the 
               geostrophic atmospheric velocity.  Works mostly by calls 
               to subroutines (uice, fndflo, flovel), then computes 
               location and performs sanity checking on the results.  
               This is where one would make the changes for running from 
               the uice given from a different sea ice model. 
uice.f     : Compute the free-drift ice velocity on a regular grid for 
               a given geostrophic wind field.  Uses Thorndike and 
               Colony, 1982 for the Arctic and Martinson and Wamser for 
               the Antarctic.
fndflo.f   : Locate each of the virtual floes with respect to the 
               regular grid.  
flovel.f   : Given uice and flovel, compute the velocity of the virtual 
               floe by bilinear interpolation.

sk2out.f   : Print out the virtual floe drift direction and distance.  
               If the point is derived from the iceline file, also print 
               the initial location of the point.

# Routines from libraries
../library/arcdis.f   : Compute the arc distance on a sphere.
../others/wdir.f      : Compute the meteorological direction of a u,v pair.
../others/spherd.f    : Do a spectral differentiation on an input field.
../others/sphert94a.f : Convert from spectral coefficients to a regular 
                          latitude-longitude grid.
