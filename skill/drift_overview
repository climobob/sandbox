The drift model predicts cumulative drift through the N days of forecast.  
The earliest NWS implementation was 2 days (Ed O'Lenic, in ~1978), by 1992, 
it had been extended to 6 days.  In 2001, it was extended to 16 days.

Verification through 2007 was done versus IABP drifting buoys only.  
In 2013, gridded satellite-derived ice drift (from IFREMER) was added to the system.

Each generation is retained for historic reference both as to methods and 
in case older model forecasts become of interest again.  An archive from 
April 1993 to present, with some gaps, is available on request.

To the future: 
differential drift verification, vs. integral (current)
scoring the higher res. gridded output
forecaster level of utility measures (e.g. AC 0.60)
