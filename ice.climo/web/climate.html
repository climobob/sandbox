<center>NCEP&nbsp;Sea Ice Climatology</center>

<p>Data for this climatology comes from a number of sources, most of them
outside NCEP.&nbsp; It is the blending of sources, rather than the data
sources which is original to NCEP.&nbsp; The purpose in developing this
climatology is to have a background field suitable for quality control
of satellite- and model-derived sea ice products.
<p>Three data sets provide the basis for the climatology:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Chapman and Walsh (<blink>finish cite)</blink> have developed a history
of sea ice cover at the end of the month for 1901 to 1990 in the Northern
Hemisphere, and from 1973 to 1990 in the Antarctic.&nbsp; The data grid
is 60 Nautical mile resolution, and does not extend below 45 N in the northern
hemisphere, which misses many peripheral ice areas.</li>

<li>
NASA Goddard (<blink>finish cite)</blink> has developed a history continuing
across much of the satellite period from SMMR and SSMI F-8, F-11, and F-13
for 1978 to 31 December 1996.&nbsp; This history has been carefully constructed
to avoid satellite drift problems (cite).&nbsp; Data are on a 25 km grid,
with values every 1-3 days (SSMI and SMMR, respectively).&nbsp; Not all
potentially ice covered zones in the northern hemisphere are included,
with parts of the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk missing, and the entire
Yellow Sea, Caspian, Aral, Sea of Azof, portions of the Gulf of St. Lawrence
missing.</li>

<li>
NCEP&nbsp;has been producing satellite-derived ice concentrations for numerical
weather prediction and sea ice analysis uses since 10/1995.&nbsp; The grids
are 25.4 km resolution, and cover all peripheral areas which can be ice
covered.&nbsp; Long term drift within sensors/platforms is not corrected,
but inter-platform differences, as for F-11 versus F-13, are allowed for.</li>
</ol>
The data sets are not wholly independant, which serves to minimize discrepancies
between them.&nbsp; NCEP&nbsp;uses the NASA-Team algorithm (<blink>finish
cite) </blink>on SSMI&nbsp;data in producing its ice products (<blink>finish
cite)</blink>.&nbsp; The only differences which should exist between these
fields are those due to gridding (the minor resolution difference), to
the data stream, where NCEP&nbsp;uses a near real time data feed and GSFC
used a later stage in the data flow, which allows better for data distribution
delays, and in the <i>a posteriori</i> adjustments which the GSFC series
can include to allow for platform/sensor drifts.&nbsp; The Chapman and
Walsh&nbsp; (<blink>finish cite)</blink>&nbsp; history is derived from
National Ice Center analyses.&nbsp; Starting with SMMR, these have included
satellite-derived information.&nbsp; In more recent times (beginning April,
1994) the NIC analyses have been made with the NCEP&nbsp;analyses in hand.&nbsp;
NIC&nbsp;analyses include other platforms as well, especially high resolution
visible and more recently SAR data.&nbsp; This does not affect the Chapman
and Walsh history, but an update to that history will include a period
when NCEP&nbsp;analyses were part of the data stream to NIC.
<p>None of the three data sets individually satisfies our goal of having
a set of fields which will inform us what the 'climatological' ice cover
is at every potentially ice covered point on the earth, for every day of
the year.&nbsp; The Chapman and Walsh data set provides the longest period
of coverage, but has only monthly time resolution and misses certain peripheral
ice areas.&nbsp; GSFC provides data every 1-3 days, but again misses some
periperal ice areas.&nbsp; NCEP provides daily coverage for every potentially
ice covered point, but has only a 5 year period of record.&nbsp; We will
therefore splice the records together as best as can be.&nbsp; The differences
between the GSFC and C+W data should reflect the effects of resolution
and of satellite biases.&nbsp; Since there are 11 years of overlap between
GSFC and C+W,&nbsp; individually anomalous years should not bias our comparisons
excessively.&nbsp; To bridge from GSFC to near real time (NCEP), we have
15 months from October 1995 through December 1996.&nbsp; As the algorithms
are identical, we only need verify that the gridding differences do not
introduce any biases.
<p>Once we complete this exercise, we will have a daily reference climatology
for ice cover which can be:
<ul>
<li>
Used to detect changes in ice cover relative to climatology</li>

<li>
Develop and assess ice prediction methods for short (days), medium (a week
or two), and long (weeks to months), against 'no skill' predictors such
as climatology, persistence, and 'cliper' (an optimal weighting of climatology
and persistence)</li>

<li>
Quality control satellite-only products</li>

<li>
Provide a basis for estimating biases between different instruments</li>
</ul>

<br>Phase 1:
<br>Chapman and Walsh history.
<p><a href="monthlies.html">First data set</a> is simply a graphical presentation
of the data in the history, a figure displaying the ice cover month by
month for the period of record, with the data having been interpolated
to the NCEP&nbsp;grid.&nbsp; The data themselves can be obtained from the
<a href="http://www.nsidc.gov/">National Snow and Ice Data Center</a>.&nbsp;
Areas of the NCEP&nbsp;grid which are not covered by the C+W history are
flagged 'no data'.
<p>The <a href="wclimatology.html">second data set</a> is in four parts:
<ol>
<li>
Simple averages of ice concentration month by month.&nbsp; That is, all
Januaries are averaged and that figure is displayed.</li>

<li>
Fourier harmonics of the climatological year defined by the above averages.&nbsp;
The mean, annual and semi-annual cycles include most of the information.
[Gloersen <blink>cite</blink> ]</li>

<li>
Conditional averages of ice concentration month by month.&nbsp; In this,
each month is represented by two fields.&nbsp; First is a field showing
the average ice concentration for those months which have ice.&nbsp; Second
is a field showing the fraction of months in the history which have an
ice cover.</li>

<li>
Fourier harmonics of the conditional average, and of the frequency of cover.</li>

These data are available for<a href="ftp://polar.wwb.noaa.gov/pub/history/ice/climate/">
ftp as grib files</a> on the NCEP&nbsp;grid.
<p>The <a href="wdaily.html">third data set</a> is reconstructed from the
fourier harmonics computed in the second data set.&nbsp; This is the daily
ice cover expected from the simple average, or the conditional average

<br>Data Phases 1-3 provide us with several different data sets.
<p>Data incomparisons:

<br>Daily fields between G and N&nbsp;(overall, and day by day during overlap

<p>Reconciliation:
<br>Since there may be climate change, especially as the northern hemisphere
data set represents 90 years and the satellites add another 10 (with 11
years overlap), it is not reasonable to require a total match between the
satellites and the pre-satellite record, or even between the two satellite
records.&nbsp; The conditional climatology, however, provides a natural
method for reconciling the disparate data sets.&nbsp; That is, in a changing
climate, the thing which changes is likely to be the probability of having
ice at a point, rather than the concentration which is present, when there
is ice present.
<p>Ways of testing between the two models of climate change representation:
<p>Biases (summer, seasonal, ...
<br>&nbsp;
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>The reconciled data set, giving images of daily expected ice covers,
is given in ...
<br>The digital&nbsp; files are given at....
<p>This is a first edition climatology.&nbsp; There are heterogeneities
still remaining in the NCEP&nbsp;climatology, not least because there are
necessary heterogeneities in the original C+W history which provides data
for much of the length of the combined data record, 90 of 100 years in
the northern hemisphere.&nbsp; These arise from the changing availability,
nature, and quality of data which can be used in constructing the climatology.&nbsp;
There are also variations imposed by the fact that data grid extents differ,
leaving some areas with a climatology based on only 5 years worth of data.&nbsp;
In a second edition, extant satellite data and relations between variations
in the peripheral sea ice cover and observed meteorological parameters
can be used to improve the representation of peripheral ice.&nbsp; Teleconnections
in ice coverage, can be used through the length of the data period, rather
than only during the sparser data periods as was done in C+W.&nbsp; This,
assuming the patterns were climate-independant, should stabilize some of
the patterns.
<p>A separate work will examine the deviations from climatology, both as
a climate change detector, and as a means of assessing methods for determining
predictive skill for different possible ice models.
