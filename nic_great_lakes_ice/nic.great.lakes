Subject:  Great Lakes Product
Status: RO

     Larry, Bob and George....we have rebuilt our Great Lakes GRASS
location (using lat/long) and produced two new sample ASCII raster files. 
Attached is a text file with the specifications...in general the specs are as
follows:  the Coastwatch domain based on the exact coordinates provided
by GLERL, 1024x1024 cell field, cell resolution (in deg:min:sec) was
generated as a byproduct of setting the grid field to 1024x1024, coordinate
system and projection is lat/long while the ellipsoid is WGS84
(George...note we did not use Clark66..if this is a problem please let me
know immediately.  You should be able to easily import the file into GRASS
using r.in.ascii).
     I have placed three files on our anonymous ftp site 140.90.54.61)...cd
to the pub directory.  File names are as follows: landoverlay_ascii,
week_12c_reclass_ascii and mailfile_oct6.  Landoverlay is the baseline file
which shows land cells as 0 and all water areas as 1.  Week_12c is an
example of the weekly product...land cells are again 0 but water areas may
be tagged as 0=ice-free and 1-9=ice concentration.  The mailfile is the
same as the attachment to this message.
     Please let me know whether you are all satisfied with this
product...besides being used as input to Bob's ice forecast model, there is
alot of high-level interest in it becoming routine input to the Eta model.   
If there are problems...please let me know.  Thanks...Dave
