Topographies (may include bathymetry):
zmask.reform -- 1 degree (from mrf?) topo/bathy in ascii
zmask        -- 1 degree (from mrf?) topo/bathy in binary (4 byte)
ETOPO5/ -- 5 minute ETOPO data set, range -10 to 5777 m, by m.
drewry/ -- Drewry atlas (?1985?) AA topography and bedrock depth files
             also derivatives aatopo.grib (1997 effort for Iredell), 
             aa.C (make 8 minute topo for Jordan)
ETOPO2/ -- NGDC 2 minute file, range -10654 to 8593 m, by m. 
DBDB2/  -- NRL 2 minute file
RAMP/   -- Antarctica at 200m and 1000m, with 8 minute and 30 second 
            topos for Jordan (2006)
topo.data -- 1 degree elevation/bathymetry file.  From (?)

Bathymetries:
tolman/
  bathy.hdeg.ascii -- 30 minute ocean bathymetry via Tolman from 
                          ETOPO5 ca. 1995
  bathy.1deg.ascii -- 60 minute ocean bathymetry via Tolman from 
                          ETOPO5 ca. 1995
lake2_bathy/ -- Great lakes bathymetries from ?Coastwatch, 
                       list of points and then lat-long location file 
                       (to 0.01 deg).
lake_bathy/  -- Great Lakes bathymetries from GLERL (David Schwab, 1980, 
                   rev 1996) 


Landmasks
landmasks/
mask.1deg -- 1 degree, binary file (1 char, 360x180), masks as sea ice
temp.orig -- nesdis 1/16th degree land masks
temphigh.linux -- above byte-flipped for linux
landmask.ntb.2 -- land mask for NASA/NSIDC sea ice analysis
swapland       -- above byte-flipped for linux
nsidcnorthland -- older land mask for NASA/NSIDC analysis
umdland/       -- U. MD land masks on 30 second grid



Shorelines:
GMT shoreline files, including their original full, high, intermediate, 
   low, and crude resolutions.  
   But also 50, 25, 15, 8, 4, 1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.0625 km versions.  
   Lakes directory (bodies of water on land, to be precise)
   Listing of bodies of water on land which are over 85 km^2 and 1225 km^2
     (approx 5 minute grid and GFS cell sizes)
