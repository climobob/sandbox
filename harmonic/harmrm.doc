harmrm (subroutine)


Entries:  harmrm
Calls  :  LINPACK routines SGEFA, SGESL

Purpose:
	Compute a least squares fit to a data vector for given frequencies (which are not required to be fourier frequencies).  This version will compute the mean at the same time as sinusoids are fit.

Limits:
	The mean (frequency = 0) must be passed as the first frequency in the frequency vector.
	The algorithm may be unnecessarily complex/time consuming. (reconsider after tides class is over.)
	The method assumes that the data are regularly spaced.
	Does not compute a condition number, so that the coefficients may be seriously contaminated by numerical errors without warning.

Arguments:
	Real x(n)		Data vector.
	Integer n		Number of data points.
	Real omega(m)	Frequencies to analyze in radians per measuring interval.
	Real a(m)		Cosine coefficient for the frequency.
	Real b(m)		Sine coeficient for the frequency.
	Integer m		Number of frequencies.

Usage:
	Fill x and omega with the appropriate data.  After the call, a and b will have the coefficients.  The first element of omega must be 0.0.
