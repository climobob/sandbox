#On the following three lines, respectively, give the full pathname of 
#the CD-ROM drive, the directory you want the data (~50 Mb) to reside in,
#and the model codes themselves.  Do _NOT_ leave a space after the = sign.
#After editing this file, chmod 554 transfer, then sh transfer and the
#required files will be copied across to your disk(s) for further use.

#Once finished with this, cd to your icemodel directory, edit travel
# to suit your system (only the first couple lines should need modification).
#Then execute sh ./travel unpack light.  This will unpack the source 
#codes for the sea ice model environment.  Note that additional directories
#will be created at the same hierarchal level as the icemodel directory 
# -- library and others.  These contain required source codes which are
#not special to the ice model.  
#travel will immediate initiate vi sessions for you to edit the files
#  'build', and bc/north.oin, bc/south.oin, bc/glk.oin.  The only lines
#  in the bc files which require modification are those specifying where
#  the '82 Levitus climatology files are (DATA below).
#Once done with that, cd to the data directory, compile the program
#bathy.f in the DATA directory, and execute it.  This will create a
#binary bathymetry file on your system.  If you are running on a cray,
#sgi, sun, hp, or linux system, you can copy the bathy.X (cry, sgi, sun,
#hp, lin) file from the cd directory bearing those system's names into
#your data directory.
#Now you are ready to build the sea ice environment.  Return to the
#icemodel directory and execute ./retry.  This will run the build
#script in the background, time the execution, and create output files
#build51 (the standard output of the build process) and build52 (the
#error message output).  The timing will appear at the bottom of the
#build52 file.  Sample output for cray, sgi, sun, hp, linux are given
#in the respective directories.  Certain build elements will fail,
#so do not worry about that.  The build expects that you have ncar
#graphics, without which some plotting programs will not get built.
#The meteorology programs expect that you have the W3 libraries
#built on your system.  The ice model itself and the programs required
#to build the fixed input files (bathymetry, ocean T, S, land mask)
#do not need the W3 libraries.  
#At this point, you should have directories icefore and execs at the
#same level as the icemodel directory, and they should contain output
#files and executables.  Icefore may be deleted.

#Finally, you are ready to run the test case.  Because of the absence
#at some locations of the W3 libraries, I've constructed an ASCII file
#which will be converted on your system to binary.  The ASCII outputs
#from the test case are given for each system.  There is some slight
#variation due to system limits.  Do verify that you match this closely
#to the standard result.  If you don't, write me at once with full
#details on your hardware/software configuration.
