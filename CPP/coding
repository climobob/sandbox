It may be worth pointing out that a more correct way of implementing this
loop is

  size_t size = BUFSIZE;
  while (size-- > 0) {
     /* ... */
  }

The original code fails in the subtle case when buf + BUFSIZE extends past
the end of the address space. Note that the ANSI C guarantee that you should
be able to compute the address of the first element beyond the end of a
named array doesn't apply if buf is dynamically allocated.

This common idiom, while it's guaranteed to work if buf is a named array of
characters, will fail if buf was dynamically allocated -- yet almost every
programmer I've seen uses the same idiom for both cases.

(See Writing Solid Code by Steve Maguire, p 132.)
