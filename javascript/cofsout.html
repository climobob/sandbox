<center><b>Description of COFS&nbsp;Output</b></center>

<p>The majority of COFS output fields are packed in the WMO standard GRIdded
Binary (GRIB) format or in ASCII files. Brief descriptions of the different
types of GRIB and ASCII files are given below. For information on reading
GRIB files, please see <a href="/gribinfo.html">click here.</a><b><i></i></b>
<p><b><i>.igb</i> file</b>: This GRIB file contains nowcasts or the 24-h
forecasts valid at 0000 UTC (8 P.M. EDT or 7 P.M. EST) on the native COFS
grid.
<p><b>.<i>sgb</i> file</b>: This GRIB file contains 1-h nowcasts or forecasts
of water levels and 1m currents on the native COFS grid for the 24-h length
of the nowcast/data assimilation or forecast cycle.
<p><b><i>.agb </i>file</b>: This GRIB file contains 24-h average and surface
fields of daily extremes on the native COFS grid for both the nowcasts
or forecasts.
<p><b><i>.stdigb </i>file</b>: This GRIB file contains 24-h forecasts valid
at 0000 UTC on a standard lat/lon grid. The grid characteristics are the
following: dimensions are 332 x 210 with a horizontal resolution of 0.1
degrees with the lower left corner at 83.05 degrees W longitude and 26.35
degrees N latitude. Variables which have been interpolated to the standard
grid are water level and temperature, salinity and currents at 31 Z-levels.
<p><b><i>.el, .tnc, .tmd, .tms </i>and <i>.tnu </i>files</b>: These files
contain hourly nowcasts or forecasts of water levels or SSTs at COFS grid
points closest to observing stations. The hourly elevation values for all
stations along the coast are contained in the .el files while the SST values
are separated into four files by geographic areas (ie. tmd = Middle Atlantic
area).
