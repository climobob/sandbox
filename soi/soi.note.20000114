DB,

  This is as much to settle my thoughts a bit as to let you know what
is up.  I've been working on the sea ice - SOI connection some more.
The nagging question, which I've been trying to not waste too much
time on, is why John Walsh, who assembled the data I'm using in the
first place and who has worked on the sea ice prediction problem for
a long time -- from a statistical point of view -- didn't publish
anything about soi links, nor the interannual predictability.  He's
only published on time ranges of a few weeks-few months.

Briefest:
  It looks very strong that a large percentage of the variance in
the Southern Hemisphere ice cover itself can be predicted at 12 and 
24 +- 3 months.  Large = 60-80 % of variance (|r| of 0.75 to 0.9).  
The half years, 6 and 18 +- 3, show little potential, variance explained 
of 20-40%.  (Statistically significant, but not impressive.)
  
  It looks strong that the SOI can be predicted at leads of up to 
24 months, with a relative maximum around 16 months.  The variance
explained is on the order of 35-50% throughout the range of 0-24 months
leads.  The figure is not impressive in its own right, but for comparison,
the soi predictions from CPC, predicting 3 month average values (I'm
doing indivicual months) are considered useful at 20% variance explained
at 9 months lead (9 being the longest range of skill -- they cannot
cross May/June even on short lead).  

Slightly Longer:
  In both cases, on the order of two dozen ice points are involved in
the predictive model, with 5-10% of variance being explained by the 
first term.  Given the 270 points which had sufficiently gap-free 
records, using 10% of them in a predictor didn't seem unreasonable.
(More than I'd like, 5% would be nicer, and could be done at a loss
of only about 20% of the otherwise explained variance.  40% down from 50%,
e.g.)

  More phenomenology:
  The spatial correlations and which points are involved in the lag
predictions do show physical behaviors: local points show relatively
high correlation, which drops off with distance, and there are remote
zones which display relatively good correlation.  As the lag increases,
the remote zones usually show a phase shift (as in the zone corresponding
to highest predictive value migrates e/w with lead, expected for a 
propagating wave of some kind).

  Interannual, but not semi-annual, 'skill' suggests that the ocean is
the driver rather than the atmosphere.  The Antarctic atmosphere is 
the type case for a semiannual pressure wave.  That the ocean 'remembers'
a light/heavy ice year from year to year is not implausible as a light
ice year should result in a changed mixed layer/thermocline that could 
be 'remembered' a year later.  The absence of skill at 6 months suggests that
a seasonal effect is involved -- the freeze or melt season is the one
and only season which truly feels the effects (whatever they are).  Test:
separate record by months and recompute.  

  I've done most with the southern hemisphere because it appears to have
the best skill on SOI.  Phenomenologies in the northern hemisphere look
proper.  The lag relations clearly picks up the Beaufort Gyre and the
Transpolar Drift.  Again there is some question of why Walsh did not
notice this in that the interannual correlations can be high.  The
northern hemisphere shows only a few percent variance explained in
soi.  (Statistically significant, given the record length, but again
not something impressive.)
