#This directory ($HOME3/inverse) contains files related to the ice
#  thickness inversion project.  Additionally, files for the cleaning
#  of ssmi analyses from the weather-contaminated NASA-Team algorithm.

#Directories are:
#  smoothing : the preliminary work on smoothing time series
#  thickness : the work on getting an ice thickness distribution.
#  therm     : estimating ice growth rates given MRF information,
#               used for trimming contaminated SSMI fields prior
#               to trying inversions.
#  predict   : thermodynamic and dynamic predictability support routines.
