Nodes for project New_Drift
edges = connectivity
weight1 = time
weight2 = person
weight3 = computer
weight4 = cpu-hrs/hour
(weights <--> resources)
weight5 = Tb disk

0  Start (depends on nothing, has no resources
(node)                                               (edge)            (weight1): (weight2) : (weight3) : (weight4)

n.b.: each node may itself be a directed graph

n.b.: Given time and schedule, check for resources required, e.g. > 24 hours of cpu in 24 hours, same person doing 32 hours of work in a day
