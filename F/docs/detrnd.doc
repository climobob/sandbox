Detrnd (subroutine)


Entries: Detrnd
Calls  : none

Purpose:
	Find the best fit line of the form y = bnot + bwon*x to the input data.  If subtr is true, subtract this line from the y vector.

Limits:
	Only computes linear fits.

Arguments:
	Real x(n)	independant variable vector
	Real y(n)	dependent variable vector
	Integer n	number of data points
	Real bnot	y intercept of the fitted line
	Real bwon	slope of the fitted line
	Real avg	Average value of the fitted line over the range of the independant variable.
	Logical subtr	Subtract the fitted line from the dependant variable if true.

Usage:
	Be certain that the independent variable is entered into the x array.
