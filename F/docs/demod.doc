Demod (subroutine)


Entries: demod
Calls  : dsin, dcos

Purpose:
	Subtract sinusoids from a vector.

Limits:
	Only good for equally spaced data.
	Requires double precision trig functions on HP 9020.
	Rather slow.
	Destroys the input vector.

Arguments:
	Real a(n)	coefficients of the cosine term
	Real b(n)	coefficients of the sine term
	Real freq(n)   frequencies of the trig. functions to subtract.
	Integer n	number of frequencies
	Real x(m)	data vector
	Integer m	number of points in data vector.

Usage:
	Fill a and b with the amplitude of the cosine and sine terms respectively.  Put the corresponding frequency (in radians per sampling interval) into freq.  The routine will then subtract the harmonics from the data vector, and return the modified vector in place of the input vector.
