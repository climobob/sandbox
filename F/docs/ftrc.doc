ftrc (subroutine)


Entries: ftrc
Calls  : ISML routine FFTRC

Purpose:
	Act as a front end for calls to the IMSL routines for computing fast fourier transforms and their inverse.

Limits:
	Does not act like a good front end: Requires the IMSL arrays to be dimensioned in the calling program, rather than the front end.
	Does not have option for computing the inverse transform.
	Only works for real data.

Arguments:
	Real f(n)		Real data vector to be transformed.
	Complex c(n)	Fast fourier transform of f
	Real buffer		currently unused
	Integer n		Number of data points in f.
	Integer iwk(3*n+150)	Array for IMSL routines.
	Real wk(3*n+150)		Array for IMSL routines.

Usage:
	Enter the data into the f vector, after the call, c will contain the real and imaginary parts of the transform.  Buffer is arbitrary.  IWK and WK must be dimensioned in the calling routine to 3*n+150, where n is the number of data points, or larger.
