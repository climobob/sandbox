correl (subroutine)


Entries: correl
Calls  : none

Purpose:
	Compute the correlation coefficient (r value) between two vectors.  As a by product, the average and standard deviations of the two vectors are also computed.

Limits:
	Arguments are in silly order.
	Can only use real data.

Arguments:
	Real x(n)	vector with the first variable
	Real y(n)	vector with the second variable
	Integer n	number of elements in the data vectors
	Real sigx	standard deviation in the first vector
	Real sigy	standard deviation in the second vector
	Real corxy	correlation between the two vectors
	Real avgx	average value of the first vector
	Real avgy	average value of the second vector

Usage:
	Fill the x and y vectors appropriately.  Use the returned parameters as desired.
