Level		1
Entries	cdemod
Calls		ritout

Purpose:
	Perform complex demodulation at a specified frequency on a given vector.  Output the results as two unformatted files for amplitude and phase.

Limits:
	Real data only.
	Only one frequency.
	Currently in program form.
	has internal write out of data - no external control or use.

Arguments:
	currently none

Usage:

Algorithm:
	Multiply the data at time i by the sine and cosine of freq*i.  The square root of the sum of the squares gives the demodulated amplitude.  The ATAN of the sine product divided by the cosine product gives the phase.
