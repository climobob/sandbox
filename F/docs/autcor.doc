autcor (subroutine)

Entries:	autcor
Calls:		none

Purpose:
	Compute the autocorrelation of a vector.

Algorithm:
	Autocorrelation at lag=K is computed by summing the product of x(i)*x(i+K) from i = 1, N-K.
	Returned vector is scaled by the value at zero lag, which puts everything on a scale of -1 to 1.

Limits:
	Algorithm is slightly incorrect.
	Requires real vectors.
	
Arguments:
	Real x	Data vector
	Integer n	Number of data points
	Real a	Autocorrelation vector [-1,+1]
	Integer len	Number of lags to use (0 to len), dimension of a=len+1

Usage:
	Pass arguments, use result.
	The choice of number of lags is fairly arbitrary, but for practical reasons (having enough points to compute a reasonable sum), should not exceed, say, half the number of data points.
