Preset (subroutine)

Entries:	preset
Calls:		none

Purpose:	
	Set a 1d vector equal to a constant.

Limits:
	Vector and constant must be real.
	No dimension limit in theory.  The size of each subscript may be multiplied to find an equivalent vector size (argument LEN) for a multidimensional array.

Arguments:
	Implicit Real Val	Scalar value to set vector elements equal to.
	Implicit Real (LEN) FWA 	Vector to set equal to scalar
	Implicit Integer Len	Number of elements to set to scalar.

Usage:
	Set arguments, use result. (See also limits)
