arav (subroutine)

Entries:	arav
Calls:		none

Purpose:
	Decimation averaging of a 2d array - average specified number of terms in x direction (first index) per term in the output array.  This is a 'stepping' rather than moving average in that n points are averaged, then the average of the next n points is computed - there is no overlap between averaged subsections.

Limits:
	Data and output arrays must be 2D, and real.

Arguments:
	Real z(m,n)	Data array
	Integer m	First dimension of z
	Integer ts	?
	Integer n	Second dimension of z
	Real zz(l,p)	Output array
	Integer l,p	First dimension of z, must be greater than or equal to m/av
	Integer p	Second dimension of zz, must be greater than or equal to n. 

The number of steps to average (av) is requested interactively.

Level 1.  Not 'field tested?' as of 12-1-88.
