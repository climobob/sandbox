calc (subroutine)

Entries:	calc
Calls:		alog10 (compute base 10 log), armxmn

Purpose:
	Reprocess data for plotting (y-x, log y-x, y-log x, log y - log x).
	Request or compute bounds on x, y plotting ranges.
	Request or compute tic mark spacing.

Algorithms:
	Computed plotting range is equal to the bounds on x, y after scaling for plotting in first part.
	Tic mark spacing is given by:
		range = max - min
		dx = 10**(alog10(range)-Trunc(alog10(range))
		dx = round(dx+0.5)
		tic = dx*10**(trunc(alog10(range)) - 1. )

Limits:
	The tic mark computation does not work well for ranges less than 1.0
	Make a function of tic computation?
	Have machine optionally select type of plot?
	Scheme for bounds computing is poor.
	2D plotting only.
	Requires both vectors even when one (x say) is simply 1-N.

Arguments:
	Real xmax, xmin, ymax, ymin	Bounds for plotting (after scaling)
	Real xtic, ytic			Tic mark spacing
	Integer size				Number of data points
	Real xraw(size), yraw(size)	Raw data
	Real x(size), y(data)		Plot scaled data
