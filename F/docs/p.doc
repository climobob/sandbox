P (real function)


Entries: p
Calls  : DEXP, DSQRT, DLOG

Purpose:
	Compute the significance statistic for the rth largest peak in m frequencies, when the Fisher's statistic is g, using the formula from Grenender and Rosenblatt, 1957.

Limits:
	Stirling's approximation to the factorial is used.
	The entire summation is computed, although in many cases the first few terms are sufficient.

Arguments:
	Integer m	number of frequencies.
	Integer r	order of the frequency being considered (it is the rth largest in the group. 
	Real g	Fisher statistic for the frequency.

Usage:
	Compute g for the frequency of interest.  Pass m, r, g to the function.  Carry out the desired tests on P.
