DMSP-F11 SSM/I Daily Sea Ice Concentration Grids for the Polar Regions

 1.	Overview
 
DMSP-F11 SSM/I daily sea ice concentration grids are produced by the
National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) using the NASA Team algorithm
with a weather filter (see Appendix).  Daily gridded data in compressed 
tar files are distributed electronically via anonymous ftp 
(ftp sidads.colorado.edu; I/P address 128.138.135.20).

 2. Production History
 
In 1989 the National Snow and Ice Data Center began processing DMSP-F8 
SSM/I daily sea ice concentration grids using the NASA Team alogrithm 
developed by Cavalieri and others (Cavalieri et al. 1984).  Because 
DMSP-F9 did not carry an SSM/I sensor, and the orbit of DMSP-F10 
was not conducive to obtaining useful polar data, DMSP-F11 SSM/I was 
selected to provide the follow-on data stream for the NSIDC 
passive microwave polar gridded time series.  DMSP-F11 SSM/I sea ice 
concentration grids, derived from the DMSP-F11 SSM/I daily averaged 
brightness temperature grids, are described in the following sections. 

In order to maximize the consistency of a time series of two or 
more sensors, a reference or baseline data set must be established.  
The DMSP-F8 SSM/I polar grids, generated by NSIDC for the five year 
period 7 July 1987 to 3 December 1991, have been thoroughly examined 
and their quality evaluated over time.   For this reason, the DMSP-F8 
SSM/I has been selected as the reference or baseline data set by 
which the quality of F11 and subsequent SSM/I data products generated 
at NSIDC will be measured.

DMSP-F11 SSM/I sea ice concentration grids were produced using the 
same algorithm as used to produce DMSP-F8 SSM/I sea ice concentration 
grids, except that the F11 grids were generated with adjusted 
F11 brightness temperatures for input. A comparison study of F8 
and F11 SSM/I brightness temperatures (Abdalati et al. 1995, in press)
showed a high correlation (greater than 0.98) between the 
brightness temperatures from the two sensors.  

Differences in orbital parameters (table 1) of the two sensors necessitated
the comparison study.  A set of regression coefficients was developed for 
application to the F11 brightness temperature values.  The recommended 
regression coefficients (table 2), when applied to the F11 gridded 
brightness temperatures, produce F11 gridded ice concentration values highly 
consistent with the F8 gridded ice concentrations.  This procedure, 
i.e. adjusting the input brightness temperatures, avoids changes to the 
ice concentration algorithm itself.  The regression coefficients are 
applied using a linear equation shown here.

	y = mx + b

	where y = new Tb value
	      m = slope of the regression line
	      x = old Tb value
	      b = intercept of the regression line

The adjustment to the F11 brightness temperature values is made at
NSIDC after production and distribution of daily F11 brightness 
temperature grids for the period 3 December 1991 through 31 August 1994.  
F11 brightness temperature grids distributed on F11 CD-ROM volumes 
do not now, and are not planned to, have this adjustment.

 3. Data Format and Content
 
The format for the SSM/I ice concentration grids is based on the 
original grid designed by the NASA Ocean Data System (NODS) at the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology. 
Please refer to "DMSP SSM/I Brightness Temperature and Sea Ice 
Concentration Grids for the Polar Regions on CD-ROM. User's Guide" 
(NSIDC 1992, rev. 1995) for more detailed information.
 
The daily data files contain ice concentration in percent
ranging from 0% to 100%.  A value of -88 (or 168 for unsigned byte
data types) indicates a land pixel, and a value of -99 (or 157 for
unsigned byte data types) indicates missing data. See the User's Guide
(NSIDC 1992, rev. 1995) for more detailed information.
 
The grids are 8-bit raster images containing 448 lines of 304 pixels
(304x by 448y) for the Northern Hemisphere, and 332 lines of 316
pixels (316x by 332y) for the Southern Hemisphere.
 
The grids are in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF), created using a
Raster Image Set (RIS) and a color palette.  See Sections 5 and 6, 
below, for more information about HDF.
 
 4. File Naming Conventions

Data files are permanently staged for ftp pickup on 
sidads.colorado.edu (IP address 128.138.135.20) in the directory 
/pub/DATA_SETS/DATA/SSMI/F11/SEAICE/DAILY.  Files are packaged in 
compressed tar format and must be extracted by the user. Each tar 
file contains all of the total, multi-year Northern or total Southern 
Hemisphere data files.

   Examples:
  
   f11_daily_ice.9112TNN.tar.Z contains all files for December 1991, 
   total ice concentration, Northern Hemisphere, NASA Team algorithm;

   f11_daily_ice.9112MNN.tar.Z contains all files for December 1991, 
   multi-year ice concentration, Northern Hemisphere, NASA Team 
   algorithm;

   f11_daily_ice.9112TSN.tar.Z contains all files for December 1991, 
   total ice concentration, Southern Hemisphere, NASA Team algorithm.

After uncompressing (use Unix "uncompress" command) and "untarring" 
these files, data files appear with the following convention: year, 
month, day, type (total or multi-year), hemisphere, and algorithm used. 

   Examples: 

   911203.TNN contains 1991 December 3, total ice concentration, Northern 
   Hemisphere, NASA Team algorithm;

   911203.MSN contains 1991 December 3, monthly ice concentration, Southern
   Hemisphere, NASA Team algorithm.

 APPENDIX
 
 The NASA Team Algorithm
 
The SSM/I Sea Ice Concentrations used were derived using the ice
concentration algorithm adopted by the NASA Sea Ice Algorithm Working
Group (SSIAWT) (Cavalieri et al. 1986). The SSIAWT (or NASATEAM)
algorithm uses four gridded brightness temperature channels: 19 GHz
vertical, 19 GHz horizontal, 22 GHz vertical and 37 GHz vertical
polarization. Ice concentrations are calculated using the gradient
ratio of 19 GHz vertical and the 19 GHz horizontal in combination with
the polarization ratio using the 19 GHz vertical against the 19 GHz
horizontal (NSIDC 1992, rev. 1995 and Cavalieri et al. 1986). The
gradient ratio is also employed by the algorithm to minimize the
calculation of "false" concentrations due to atmospheric moisture. If
the gradient ratio is greater than .05, then the ice concentration is
set to 0.
 
A serious problem in mapping the sea ice in both hemispheres has been
the false indication of sea ice over the open ocean and at the ice
edge.  These spurious sea ice concentrations result from the presence
of atmospheric water vapor, nonprecipitating cloud liquid water, rain
and sea surface roughening by surface winds.  While these effects are
relatively minor at polar latitudes in winter, they result in serious
weather contamination problems at all latitudes in summer (Cavalieri
et al. 1992).
 
This problem was addressed for sea ice concentrations derived from the
Nimbus 7 SMMR data through the development of a weather filter
(Gloersen and Cavalieri 1986).  The filter is based on the
polarization (PR18) and spectral gradient ratio (GR37/18) distribution
of ice-free and ice-covered seas.  If GR(37/18) is greater than 0.08,
then the sea ice concentration is set to zero.
  
While this eliminates most of the unwanted weather effects, it also
eliminates sea ice concentrations less than 15%.  This is not
considered a serious problem for most applications, because the
ice-edge has previously been defined as the 15% ice concentration
contour as determined from satellite radiometers.
 
Application of a GR(37/19) filter for use with sea ice concentration
maps derived with the SSM/I sensor is less successful, because the
19.35 GHz SSM/I channels are significantly closer to the center of the
22.2 GHz atmospheric water-vapor line and thus are more sensitive to
changes in atmospheric water vapor resulting in greater contamination
problems.
 
A new weather filter has been developed (Cavalieri et al. 1994) and
delivered to the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder,
Colorado, for routine processing of the SSM/I data for generating sea
ice concentration maps. The new filter is a combination of the
original SSM/I GR(37/19), which effectively eliminates most of the
spurious concentrations resulting from wind-roughening of the ocean
surface and from cloud liquid water, with another GR filter based on
the 22.2 GHz and 19.35 GHz channels.  The rationale for using
GR(22/19) is based partly on the sensitivity of the 22.2 GHz to water
vapor and partly on the need to minimize the effect of ice temperature
variations at the ice edge.
    
This new weather filter works as follows. If GR(37/19) is greater than
0.05 and/or GR(22/19) is greater than 0.045, the sea ice concentration
is set to zero.  These GR thresholds effectively eliminate most of the
weather contamination, except for winds greater than about 30 m/s,
cloud liquid water more than 24 cm, water vapor greater than 0.2 cm,
and rain rates greater than 12 mm/hr.  Except for a few case studies
completed during the development of this filter, the extent to which
it eliminates ice edge concentrations in different regions of the
Arctic and Antarctic for different seasons is unknown.  Work is
currently underway to determine the overall effectiveness of the new
SSM/I weather filter.
