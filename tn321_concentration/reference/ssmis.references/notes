Hi Bob,

I am no longer processing SSM/IS myself. I save what's in production from /dcom/us007003/YYYYMMDD/b021 into /global/noscrub/wx22gk/ssmis/tanks/YYYYMMDD/b021. So, yes. The /nwprod/fix/bufrtab.021 is up to date with the tanks I am saving.

Dennis Keyser has a utility that I use to read the BUFR data called bufrdump.datadump. It's located on Cirrus or Stratus under /meso/save/wx22dk/prepbufr/. The command is...

sh /meso/save/wx22dk/prepbufr/bufrdump.datadump /path/tank <output file> .

The output file will be saved in a newly created /stmp/$USER/bufrdump.datadump directory. For SSM/IS data, it takes a while to create the output file, since these tanks are usually large in size. You can use bufrtab.021 as a guide for the information you need, but the output file has a brief description of each mnemonic after the value.

Hope this helps,
Greg
