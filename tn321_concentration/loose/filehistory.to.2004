Notes on files used in the sea ice concentration analysis system, or 
about, or connected to.  Spans 1992-2004ish.  These are in general legacy 
notes.  But they are saved rather than relying on Grumbine memory of 
details for codes developed across 20+ years.  This runs through a status 
of approximately 2004 -- when the current high resolution system was 
implemented.  From this point on, documentation improves and the system 
is less mutable.
