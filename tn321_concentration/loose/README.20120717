... several updates since 2004, documentation to come

2004
Land masks updated

1 March 2000
  New land mask and transfer scheme from the native polar stereographic
maps implemented in online archive.  An _a posteriori_ computation of
the global ice fields using the new scheme is in progress.

  File naming convention changed to 4 digit years (finally).  Archive
directory will maintain old 2 digit year names until June 2000.


9 July 1998
The June, 1998 file was delayed but is now available.  June 5, 1998 is
not present, though all other missing days were recovered.  

Work is under way to construct a more uniform time series (both in
processing methods and in presentation, e.g. the change from 1 to 0.5
degrees which occurs at 31 October 1995 in the current version).
 

15 April 1997
Ice concentration fields for the NCEP/NCAR Climate Data Assimilation System.  
For details of how the fields are created, request 'Automated Passive 
Microwave Sea Ice Concentration Analysis at NCEP'. This document is
also available as a postscript file in 
ftp://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/papers/ssmi120.ps  

The data here are 1 degree grids in GRIB format for the CDAS from 1 
January 1995 through 30 October 1995.  From 31 October 1995 onward, the
data are 0.5 degree GRIB fields.

During a month, each day's GRIB file will be placed here.  After the
end of the month, the entire month's data will be concatenated to a 
single file and put in the archive subdirectory.  After the end of the 
year, the individual months will be concatenated and the file compressed.
(Still in the archive subdirectory).
