A _region_ is a _set of points_
-- which are _contiguous_
-- which have a _type point_ (base point, key point)
-- which are mutually correlated
-- which are more highly correlated to their type-point
           than any other type point

n.b.: Might be that a given point is not part of any reasonable region.
n.b.: Might be that best (cover greatest area) type point(s) for N region(s)
         are not among the best for N+1 regions.

score(ij) = sum (variance(kl) * area * r^2(i,j; k,l)) for all k,l
